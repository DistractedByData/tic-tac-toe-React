# Project Introduction 
In this project I build the classic game, tic tac toe. 

I was motivated to create this simple React app because I am very interested in learning more about React as a frontend framework. While this project is fairly basic, I tend to benefit from focusing on the basics when tackling a new subject/topic. By gaining a solid understanding of important concepts and the fundamentals, I am better able to continue building on the solid foundation. So eventually I will be more capable with creating more complex projects.

I found the idea for [this project](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) on the React website, where they have many very helpful guides.
